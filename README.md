üõ°Ô∏è SQLi Testing Tool

Automated SQL Injection Testing Tool with Subdomain Enumeration & SQLmap

This tool automates the subdomain enumeration, endpoint extraction, and SQL injection testing process. It combines various tools to streamline the security testing workflow.

üìç How It Works

The tool follows these steps:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Subdomain Enumeration (Subfinder)

    The tool runs Subfinder to discover subdomains of the target domain.

    Results are saved in subdomains.txt.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Live Subdomain Check (Httpx)

    It verifies which subdomains are alive by making HTTP requests.

    Results are saved in live_subdomains.txt.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Endpoint Extraction

    Uses Katana to extract URLs & API endpoints from live subdomains.

    Optionally, uses Waybackurls to retrieve historical endpoints.

    Saves results in final_endpoints.txt.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Filtering & Deduplication

    Extracts only URLs with query parameters (for potential SQL injection).

    Filters only one URL per unique parameter to avoid redundant testing.

    Saves results in unique_param_urls.txt.

5Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Injection Testing (SQLmap)

    Specified Testing Mode:

        User selects high-risk SQLi parameters (id=, query=, user=, etc.).

        Runs SQLmap only on endpoints containing those parameters.

    General Testing Mode:

        Runs SQLmap on all extracted parameterized URLs.

        If more than 200 endpoints, it splits them into batches.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Results & Reporting

    SQLmap outputs the results, including detected vulnerabilities.

    Saves vulnerable endpoints in vulnerable_endpoints.txt.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies 

Run the following commands:
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y subfinder httpx sqlmap
